/* 
 * Project Euler Problem: 002
 * Link: Link: https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
 *
 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous 
 * two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 *
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 *
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
 * four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
